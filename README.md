# Forlorn_Fox_game_engine_core
The core of game engine that uses Lua to build games. (Counterpart: Forlorn_Fox_lua_game_framework)

NOTE: All files should be compiled as C++ apart from sqlite3.c, which should be compile as C.

For a Linux build, you probably want to omit: "wsocket.c", "gem.c","lua.c", "luac.c"
